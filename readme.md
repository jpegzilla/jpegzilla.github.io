## hello!

this is my new website 2022!!

this is my new website, meant to be some sort of culmination of everything I've learned so far and a showcase of my development talent as well as design and personal philosophy. it will serve as a hub from which to access all my projects as well as my bio, social media, blog, external resources, etc.

in every file (unless I forgot some), you'll see a comment with a link to something I was listening to while writing that particular file. if you'd even wanna know something like that, lol.

_todo:_

-   [ ] make an 'other materials' section that picks randomly from my projects and links to them, so sometimes there will be links to my old portfolio, my experiments folder, my misc folder, etc.
-   [ ] add a music collection viewer thing (probably going to take a while)
