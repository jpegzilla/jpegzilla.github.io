## hello!

this is my new website, meant to be some sort of culmination of everything I've learned so far and a showcase of my development talent as well as design and personal philosophy. it will serve as a hub from which to access all my projects as well as my bio, social media, blog, external resources, etc.

*todo:*

-   [ ] make the 'other materials' section pick randomly from my projects and link to those, so sometimes there will be links to my old portfolio, my experiments folder, my misc folder, etc.

-   [x] comment my javascript (now you can make fun of my code *and* my thought process)

-   [ ] refactor javascript slightly so I can just use webpack or something

-   [ ] add the music collection viewer thing (probably going to take a while)
