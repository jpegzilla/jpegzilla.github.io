          "p1": "<p>As someone who likes to save money, I decided to host my blog on Github Pages. That meant that I'd have no access at all to server-side technologies like PHP or Node with which to construct some sort of dynamic blog, because Github Pages is strictly static. I'd heard of ways to create a blog easily on Pages, like Jekyll, but instead I decided to try making my own blog - without: <br><br>1. researching how to do it <span class=\"it\">correctly</span><br>2. using NodeJS or PHP to get articles from a database (probably closer to the right way to do it)<br>3. any knowledge of how blogging platforms/applications work.<br><br>I <span class=\"it\">did</span>, however, know a couple of things:<br><br>1. This is probably <span class=\"it\">terrible</span> for SEO.<br>2. It's pretty tedious to write articles in the way that I decided to store them (more on that later).<br><br> Since you're reading this now, I assume that I followed through on this ridiculous project. Ridiculousness aside, I learned a <span class=\"it\">lot</span> about JSON and javascript during this project. I did not, however, learn anything about how to build a halfway decent or efficient blogging platform. All I started with was a few lines of HTML that I figured were enough to render dynamically content inside. </p>"

        {
          "p2": "<p>I planned to just take the content and use Jquery functions like <span class=\"code\">.text()</span> and <span class=\"code\">.append()</span> to put in content where it needed to go.</p>"
        },
        {
          "p3": "<p>That was tame compared to what I did next. The dilemma I had come across was the fact that regular Javascript alone has no way to read a directory on a server, meaning that if I wanted to get a list of articles I've written and create links to them (yet another limitation coming from not having access to any sort of backend). So I thought of a few different ways to get a list of articles and the content of those articles until I came up with a really strange idea.</p>"

        {
          "i2": "<img src=\"img/json-structure.png\" alt=\"image of my JSON structure, where I write the articles to retrieve later.\" />"
        },
        {
          "p4": "<p>If you've ever done web development or something similar, you'll know that this is an image of a JSON file. This is what I came up with to store all the articles in a way that Javascript could read and that I could easily manipulate and retrieve information from. I sort of thought of it like a document in a MongoDB database, minus a way to write to the document. I wrote an ajax request to get the JSON file from my website:</p>"

          "p5": "<p>The function <span class=\"code\">loadArticle()</span> will then take the information from that post and format it into a post that looks just like the one you're reading now. I wrote a couple of helper functions including one that just takes a date in the format \"YYYYMMDD\" and splits it into a \"YYYY MM DD\" format like you can see at the beginning of this article.</p>"
        },
        {
          "p6": "<p>Maybe in the future I'll write some kind of compiler, almost like a Markdown compiler. It would take a file I write with some kind of Markdown-like syntax and convert it into this weird JSON structure I've concieved.</p>"
