#p <hr>

#p <span class="i">the label that released this album, which is an internal recording label of konami's bemani music branch, has been on hiatus for about ten years. however, I think the album is available to purchase on [a apple music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/cyber-beatnation-2-hi-speed-conclusion/484835927). you can also try and get the cd [a here](https://otaku.com/products/34266).</span>

#p [d C]hances are, if an artist appears on [a remywiki](https://remywiki.com/Cyber_beatnation_2_-Hi_Speed_conclusion-) (a website documenting rhythm games / rhythm game music), I probably love them. so of course, I've been listening to this album nonstop all this week.

#p I'm a huge fan of high-speed, high-energy and especially intentionally crazy music like denpa (post on that coming soon). on top of that, this album is essentially a megamix. with the average bpm somewhere around 180, each song flows seamlessly into the next one. listening through the entire album in order is such a great experience &mdash; and I've done it multiple times over the past week or so while writing code.

#p I'm not going to go over every song, but just know that if you like rhythm-game adjacent music in general, especially the type of music featured in the [i bemani] series or [i dance dance revolution], you'll probably like this album. here are some of the tracks I thought were really notable:

#h2 [a track five - ryu☆ - mind mapping (kors k mix).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOf3WLwy258)

#p kors k, a massive name in the rhythm game scene, remixing one of the most well-known [a iidx empress](https://remywiki.com/AC_EMPRESS) tracks of all time. empress was probably my favorite in the series in terms of new tracks, because it also brought other legendary songs like kors k's [a smooooch・∀・](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PARCgURBOOI). mind mapping, of course, is one of those bangers &mdash; and this remix is pretty intense.

#h2 [a track twelve - ryu☆ - bass 2 bass (dj max steroid remix).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYRWTU1fbk)

#p another legendary song from the original [a jubeat](https://remywiki.com/AC_jb). sota fujimori (dj max steroid, sota, system s.f.) brings bass 2 bass to a whole new level with complex synth riffs, some fat basslines, and of course, a higher bpm.

#h2 [a track fifteen - ryu☆ - starmine (hommarju remix).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8XXaf3kZ_4)

#p this is definitely one of the most powerful songs on the album. it's a remix of a song from ryu's first album, [i starmine], and it's done by one of the greatest producers to [i ever] come from the exit tunes label. it's a very well known fact that [a hommarju](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnaiuof3rjM) [a has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1Oyj3NogfY) [a never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gowu9eNWpo) [a made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gowu9eNWpo) [a a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P4M7ukrDZk) [a bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl2KL-jOcs0) [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0YVyLoDkd8). this remix is not an exception to that rule &mdash; just one of the most legendary rhythm game / doujin producers bringing the heat again.

#p thanks for reading! I'm still listening to music ninety percent of my waking hours, so I'll keep getting these music-related posts out as much as I can. maybe I'll introduce someone to their new favorite artist. see you next time (probably next week with another album of the week).
