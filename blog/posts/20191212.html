        <div id="mkzBody">
          <p>
            <span class="d">O</span>ver the past few months, I've been working
            on a
            <a target="_blank" href="https://jpegzilla.com/emerald"
              >piece of software designed to make it easier to create color
              palettes</a
            >. as a result of that, I've had to learn a lot about color science
            and stuff, so I thought I'd share what I've learned. so, here are
            three methods I've used in emerald to programatically generate color
            palettes. all code is in javascript.<br />
            <hr />
          </p>
          <h2>method one: gradients.</h2>
          <p>
            this method might just be the easiest one &mdash; interpolating
            between two colors is fairly simple. you take one color and use it
            as the starting point, and then mathematically alter that color
            until you reach the second color.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-gradient-gen-1.png"
            alt="the code that interpolates between two colors."
            title="the code that interpolates between two colors."
          />
          <p>
            essentially, this function takes in two arrays of three rgb values
            each and a factor to modify the colors by. then, it essentially maps
            each value in the first array to a new value that's a derivative of
            the first and second array's corresponding values, modified by the
            factor. if I were to implement this again, I'd probably just use
            javascript's <span class="c">array.prototype.map()</span> or
            something. I used <span class="c">slice()</span> as a quick way to
            create a copy of the original array. there are other ways to do
            this, of course, but that must have been the first thing that came
            to mind for whatever reason.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-gradient-gen-2.png"
            alt="more of the code that interpolates between two colors."
            title="more of the code that interpolates between two colors."
          />
          <p>
            the rest of the interpolate function creates the actual array of
            newly generated colors by taking in the amount of steps to
            interpolate by (which in my case is just an option in emerald's
            settings) and the two original colors. it loops through each step
            and spits out a new array of the gradient. say, for example, I put
            in white and black, and a factor of ten (default):
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-gradient-gen-3.png"
            alt="a generated palette in emerald from white to black. I like how that particular shade of grey is just called 'cape cod'."
            title="a generated palette in emerald from white to black. I like how that particular shade of grey is just called 'cape cod'."
          />
          <p>and here's an example from red to blue:</p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-gradient-gen-4.png"
            alt="a generated palette in emerald from red to blue."
            title="a generated palette in emerald from red to blue."
          />
          <p>
            and here's one with the count set to ten colors and the factor set
            to ten.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-gradient-gen-5.png"
            alt="a generated palette in emerald from red to blue, with ten steps."
            title="a generated palette in emerald from red to blue, with ten steps."
          />
          <p>
            I haven't written a way to export a palette with ten colors (because
            drawing on an html <span class="c"><\canvas></span> is hard
            sometimes...).
          </p>
          <h2>method two: analogous colors.</h2>
          <p>
            analogous colors are groups of directly adjacent colors. for my
            implementation, I created a loop that creates a new color in an
            array by shifting the hue of the previous color in the array by
            whatever factor the user defines.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-analogous-gen-1.png"
            alt="the code that generates an analogous palette."
            title="the code that generates an analogous palette."
          />
          <p>
            and for reference, here's the
            <span class="c">shiftHue</span> function, which just takes in a
            color object with the r, g, and b values as keys, modifies the hue
            of the color by any amount of degrees, and spits out the new rgb
            color:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-analogous-gen-0.png"
            alt="the code that generates an analogous palette."
            title="the code that generates an analogous palette."
          />
          <p>
            this one is somewhat subjective. another method you could try is
            using adjacent colors on either side of the original color. here's
            what I mean (gracefully illustrated in ms paint):
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-analogous-gen-2.png"
            alt="I went to savannah college of art and design. this is the best I could do."
            title="I went to savannah college of art and design. this is the best I could do."
          />
          <p>here's what emerald does (at least in analogous mode!):</p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-analogous-gen-3.png"
            alt="I pay twenty dollars a month for adobe illustrator, and I use ms paint to draw diagrams."
            title="I pay twenty dollars a month for adobe illustrator, and I use ms paint to draw diagrams."
          />
          <p>
            and finally, here's an example of an analogous color palette
            generated in emerald from the colors 'spanish sky blue' and
            'picasso'. it's actually really pretty! it's really obvious from
            this picture that the hue has only been modified in one direction.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-analogous-gen-4.png"
            alt="analogous palette generated in emerald from the colors 'spanish sky blue' and 'picasso'."
            title="analogous palette generated in emerald from the colors 'spanish sky blue' and 'picasso'."
          />
          <h2>method three: monochromatic palettes.</h2>
          <p>
            call me boring, but monochromatic palettes are really beautiful to
            me. limitations breed creativity, of course, but that's only one of
            the reasons why it's so fun to use monochromatic palettes. this
            method is pretty dead simple:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-monochrome-gen-1.png"
            alt="monochrome palette generation code."
            title="monochrome palette generation code."
          />
          <p>
            again, this just involves a loop that runs as many times as the user
            has specified. however, instead of shifting the hue, this time we're
            just shifting from the last color's saturation. here's what
            <span class="c">shiftSat</span> does (converting from rgb to hsl,
            changing saturation, and converting back to rgb):
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-monochrome-gen-2.png"
            alt="the utility function for shifting a color's saturation."
            title="the utility function for shifting a color's saturation."
          />
          <p>
            you might have noticed from the first image that the saturation
            unconditionally shifts saturation downward. of course, if you have a
            color with low saturation already, this results in something like
            this:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-monochrome-gen-3.png"
            alt="white white white white white white white white...."
            title="white white white white white white white white...."
          />
          <p>
            right now, all I'd have to do is change the sign of the factor from
            negative to positive depending on how saturated the color is. that's
            coming in the next release of emerald for me &mdash; but for
            you...you already know how to handle it, so don't make the same
            mistake I did! and, for good measure, here's a pretty monochrome
            palette from emerald based on lavender:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-monochrome-gen-4.png"
            alt="I love the color purple more than I love myself."
            title="I love the color purple more than I love myself."
          />
          <p>
            and a similar palette with a higher modification factor (twenty):
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/emerald-monochrome-gen-5.png"
            alt="ok, this is a little too much purple, maybe. but you get the point."
            title="ok, this is a little too much purple, maybe. but you get the point."
          />
          <p>
            <span class="b">notes regarding emerald:</span>
            <span class="i"
              >sometimes colors in emerald are so close that they are named as
              the same color. I might fix that later if I can find / create a
              larger color name library.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="i"
              >also, if you set the modification factor really really high, like
              a hundred, and you're only modifying saturation, you'll only get
              two colors repeating alternately. because if you take too much
              saturation out of a color, the saturation shifting function just
              'loops around' to the max / min saturation. the max saturation of
              a color is only one hundred, anyway.</span
            ><br />
            <hr />
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="d">A</span>nyway, that's about it for now. I'll be
            adding new palette generation functionality to emerald sometime
            early next year &mdash; I already have the framework laid for
            complementary palettes. thanks for reading, and I'll be back in
            <span class="i c">(indeterminate amount of time)</span> with another
            hopefully useful post!<br />
