          <p>
            <span class="d">O</span>ver the years, I've spent a lot of time
            doing research. as a completely self-taught web developer, I've
            gotten pretty damn good at finding things on the internet. and
            besides, I'm super <span class="i s">nosy</span> hungry for
            information on anything and everything. so, I've learned a lot about
            how to absolutely scour the depths of the web for the information I
            need.
          </p>
          <p>
            anyway, something that I wanted to write about for a while is
            effective searching techniques. a lot of things &mdash; such as
            knowing where to look to find certain information &mdash; come with
            years of experience. <span class="i">"search techniques?"</span> you
            might be thinking.

          </p>
          <p>
            do you <span class="i">really</span> though? because most people's
            search techniques are like an old kitchen knife. it does the job,
            but you kind of wish you could cut a little faster. if you continue
            reading this series, though, I'll swap out

          <h2>number one: searching for specific text.</h2>
          <p>
            most good search engines have special syntax for crafting better
            search queries. in regards to google, the best technique for finding
            specific text &mdash; if you already know exactly what phrase you
            want to find &mdash; is to just wrap your search in double quotes
            "like this". of course, this goes much, much deeper. the two search
            engines I most often use, google and duckduckgo, both have tons of
            special syntax that's sort of reminiscent of a query language like
            sql or cql.
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433"
              >here is google's syntax</a
            >, and
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/syntax/"
              >duckduckgo's is here.</a
            >. memorize just <span class="i">a few</span> of these and you'll
            easily cut your time spent searching in half.
          </p>

            title="just a couple of methods google offers to refine your search."
          />
          <h2>number two: searching complex ugc (user generated content).</h2>
          <p>
            okay, here's where it starts getting a little more interesting. user
            generated content is what makes the internet what it is. I'm talking
            about blog posts, forum discussions, documents, open source code,
            social media posts...the list goes on. here are a few things I do
            when searching user generated content.
          </p>
          <p>
            one of the most important things to take into consideration here is
            language. it's much easier to search within ugc that's written in
            your native language, because you'll understand irregularities,
            you'll be able to mentally gloss over typos, etc. you do need to
            keep things like that in mind when searching.
          </p>
          <h3>example one: blogs, inurl, and site.</h3>
          <p>
            ok, I'll use a recent example from my real life. say I'm using
            google, and looking for information on
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining"
              >optional chaining</a
            >, and I only want to see blog-type ugc. and for the sake of the
            exercise let's say I don't have
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swapagarwal/mediumship"
              >a way to bypass medium's paywall</a
            >, so I want to exclude it:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/search-blog-inurl-nomedium.png"
            alt="searching for optional chaining on blog sites, but not on medium."
            title="searching for optional chaining on blog sites, but not on medium."
          />
          <p>
            and if I really wanted to see medium links? I'd combine the
            <span class="c">site:</span> and
            <span class="c">inurl:</span> operators to get really specific
            &mdash;
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/search-blog-inurl-medium.png"
            alt="searching for optional chaining in javascript, using medium."
            title="searching for optional chaining in javascript, using medium."
          />
          <p>
            here's something you might run into as you start using more and more
            advanced search techniques: search engines like google will
            sometimes think your search traffic might be coming from a bot:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/search-captcha.png"
            alt="google's page telling me that there's unusual traffic coming from my network."
            title="google's page telling me that there's unusual traffic coming from my network."
          />
          <p>from google's explanation (emphasis mine):</p>
          <img
            src="./../img/search-captcha-explanation.png"
            alt="google's explanation that I am behaving like a robot."
            title="google's explanation that I am behaving like a robot."
          />
          <p>
            and that's no big deal, it just means your searching is getting more
            powerful.
            <span class="i">you're becoming one with the machine.</span>
          </p>
          <h3>example two: forums, discussions, and combo syntax.</h3>
          <p>
            forums are among the most complex information sources that can be
            searched on the internet. in fact, I'd like to write an entire
            seperate post about how to efficiently search forums. message
            boards, forums, and the like very often contain threads and
            discussions that can span hundreds of pages of highly unpredictable
            &mdash;
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law"
              >and sometimes very predictable</a
            >
            &mdash; content. this makes them difficult to search, but not
            impossible. the key here is to use the correct tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            so here's the example: say I'm an artist who just found out about
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.systemax.jp/en/sai/"
              >paint tool sai</a
            >, one of the most popular illustration applications, and I want to
            see what other artists are saying about it. I'd want to find a
            forum, and I'd want to find a discussion among my peers, who I know
            are denizens of the notorious
            <a target="_blank" href="https://deviantart.com">deviantart.com</a>.
            here's what my query would look like:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/search-combine-site-inurl.png"
            alt="combining site, inurl, and a search term."
            title="combining site, inurl, and a search term."
          />
          <p>
            I'd immediately find what I was looking for. however, what if I
            wanted to see other discussions going on on other sites? I could
            change my query to
            <span class="c">paint tool sai inurl:forum</span> or something like
            that. I could also use a little extension called
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/discussions-button-for-go/igjiggoeheaondbmhmilpmbdkpgcjmdn"
              >discussions button for google search</a
            >
            which would construct a
            <span class="u"
              ><abbr title="in a good way though">nasty</abbr></span
            >
            little combo for me to find pretty much any and every forum
            discussion on the topic I want. with this extension, I click on that
            little "discussions" button in the screenshot above and my query
            becomes:
          </p>
          <code
            >paint tool sai
            inurl:forum|viewthread|showthread|viewtopic|showtopic|"index.php?topic"
            | intext:"reading this topic"|"next thread"|"next topic"|"send
            private message"</code
          >
          <p>
            and if you're further along in your self-mechanization than me, and
            you've perfectly memorized search syntax, then you can do what this
            extension does on your own. I'm a human though (I think), so I just
            use the extension.
          </p>
          <h3>example three: using established archives.</h3>
          <p>
            online communities grow and change over time, some more rapidly than
            others. websites get restructured, content is removed or replaced,
            users delete their profiles and move to other sites, and so forth.
            as a result, sometimes you'll find yourself seeking information that
            technically no longer exists &mdash; at least not as it used to.
            this is where archives come in handy.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/search-wayback.png"
            alt="the internet archive's wayback machine."
            title="the internet archive's wayback machine."
          />
          <p>
            there are a few archive sites out there, but none are really as good
            as the internet archive's wayback machine. you've probably heard
            about this one at least once in your life, even if you don't use it
            every day. so say you're researching some obscure topic through a
            web of ancient forum threads scattered around multiple websites and
            you come across a thread that got wiped by mods or locked or
            something.
          </p>
          <p>
            sometimes all you have to do is throw the link to the page into the
            wayback machine &mdash; <span class="i">et voilà!</span> &mdash;
            (sometimes) the page will have been archived in the past and you can
            read it in it's original glory. example: I was reading a
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://forum.starmen.net/forum/General/BFG/45107/page/7/"
              >thread</a
            >
            that ran from two thousand eight &mdash; two thousand nine, and one
            particular user's comments seemed to all be missing, leaving pretty
            significant gaps in the discussion. I don't know why; maybe they
            deleted their account or something.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/yume-thread-before.png"
            alt="this person's blank comments are leaving odd gaps in the conversation."
            title="this person's blank comments are leaving odd gaps in the conversation."
          />
          <p>
            I was lucky that an
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Internet"
              >alexa crawler</a
            >
            had been there way, way before me (about ten years ahead of me) and
            there was an archived copy on the wayback machine as a result.
          </p>

              >the archived original thread</a
            >
            contains the comments I needed to read, the original profile
            pictures, badge sprites, and the original exact timestamps. it was
            like going back in time and seeing exactly what the actual forum
            participants would have seen. it's like visiting a memorial of some
            event or other, and being surrounded by the ghosts of the people who
            were present for the actual event.
          </p>
          <p>
            the comment I was missing in particular was posted april first, two
            thousand nine at two twenty-one pm &mdash; exactly three thousand,
            nine hundred fifteen days, twenty-two hours, and fifty-seven minutes
            ago from the writing of this line.<br />

              >ota bene: when traversing the rapidly shifting landscape of
              internet ugc, keep in mind that time distortion and erosion are
              very real things. for example, the content that I found on that
              thread mentioned above was on page seven. ten years ago, that same
              content was on a different page, so I had to search for it in the
              archived copy. that's just a fairly mundane example, so watch out
              when you're searching. things change, so it's often more important
              to see the forest than the trees. you just need to understand the
              shape of the content &mdash; that's what informs your navigation.
              and that comes with experience.</span

            <span class="i"
              >if you're good enough, you can find people having similar
              discussions at similar times in history across huge divides
              between ugc. tracking synchronicity between even two to four
              sources becomes almost exponentially more difficult as time wears
              on, but it is nearly always possible. I use the term erosion when
              it comes to cases like this, but it's more like dispersion, in all
              honesty. just remember that (most of the time) nothing is truly
              lost &mdash; if you know how to look for it.</span

            once you find the resource you actually want, though, how do you
            search within it? how do you cross-reference? you need to quickly be
            able to parse a large amount of textual information, and jump from
            point to point in the page as nimbly as a web crawler could...which
            brings me to technique number three.
          </p>
          <h2>
            number three: cross-referencing / searching within a text resource.
          </h2>
          <p>
            cross-referencing on a page becomes much easier when you can just
            immediately jump to the text you want to see, right? so here's
            technique number three:
            <span class="c">ctrl (cmd for macs) + f / ctrl + g</span>. both key
            combinations will bring up a search box to type into, and
            immediately jump to the word or phrase you type in.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/search-ctrl-f.gif"
            alt="example of the ctrl-f function."
            title="example of the ctrl-f function."
          />
          <p>
            it will even show you the amount of ocurrences of a term on a page,
            and you can go to the next ocurrence by hitting enter or f3.
          </p>
          <p>
            look, I get it. you already know this one.

          <h2>number four: searching for special characters.</h2>
          <p>
            when using a traditional search engine, sometimes special characters
            are ignored, or even treated like special search syntax, such as in
            the case of google always treating the asterisk (*) as a wildcard
            operator. it can be difficult to search for something that has a
            special character in it's name, which is why a specialized engine
            called
            <a target="_blank" href="http://symbolhound.com/">symbolhound</a>
            exists.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/search-symbolhound.png"
            alt="the homepage of symbolhound."
            title="the homepage of symbolhound."
          />
          <p>
            as you can see, this is mainly for people who, like me, need to
            search for strings with unconventional character combinations in
            them, mainly relating to some programming language or another. it's
            not super strong as a general purpose engine, and certainly is not
            perfect.
          </p>
          <p>
            there are a few ways you can search for special symbols on
            traditional search engines, though, including using the literal
            spelling of the symbol you're looking for.
          </p>
          <h2>number five: avoiding bias.</h2>
          <p>
            there exists, of course, a certain amount of bias when using a
            search engine. there are three main biases that I'm talking about
            here: <span class="b">confirmation bias</span>, the
            <span class="b">baader–meinhof effect</span>, and the bias caused by
            <span class="b">search engines tracking your search history.</span>
          </p>
          <h3>example one: confirmation bias and the baader–meinhof effect.</h3>
          <p>
            also known as the frequency illusion, this is a type of cognitive
            bias that refers to humans' disposition toward noticing patterns,
            names, and other information with highly increased frequency after
            initially being exposed to that information. this most definitely
            goes in hand with confirmation bias, and if your goal is to perform
            effective, unbiased, and objective searching, you have to at least
            be aware of it to try to mitigate its effects.<br />

            <hr />
          </p>
          <p>
            you don't always want to find <span class="i">only</span> what you
            think you need to know, and paying special attention to only a
            certain type of information can lead to unfruitful searches. for
            example, maybe you notice a discussion going on about a new movie
            you've seen recently. the thread is mostly positive information.
          </p>
          <p>
            you continue looking for information about the movie, and you
            continue finding positive information &mdash; through no coincidence
            at all. you may conclude "oh, everyone loves this movie!" and never
            see any information saying otherwise, because you selectively gave
            attention to the information you wanted to believe. you remain
            unaware, even, of the <span class="i">scope</span> of the
            information you're missing out on &mdash;
            <a
              target="_blank"

              >you're not even aware of what you don't know</a
            >. and this is only a fairly innocent example of the effects of this
            bias.
          </p>
          <h3>example two: the search history bias.</h3>

          />
          <p>
            over ten years ago, google started allowing searches to be
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/personalized-search-for-everyone.html"
              >affected by a user's search history</a
            >. essentially, this introduces some result skewing based on a
            user's previous searches. this effect is often not noticeable to the
            average google user at all, but in some cases, it is very very
            obvious. it can also be difficult to get a good example of because
            it happens fairly rarely. if this <span class="i">is</span> actually
            affecting you, then take a look at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://duckduckgo.com/">duckduckgo!</a>,
            which doesn't track you or your search history at all.<br />

            the internet is massive, and only getting larger. and no matter how
            obscure the thing you're researching is, chances are someone else
            has what you want and posted it at some point. you are never truly
            alone. that is the nature of the web.

            if this was too basic for you though, I'll be back with a post about
            searching audiovisual content soon &mdash; which can be very
            complicated. so stay tuned if you think that's interesting! thanks
