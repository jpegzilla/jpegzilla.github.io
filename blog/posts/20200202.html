            <span class="d">T</span>he internet is a wasteland (more on that
            later). this has its ups and downs, but it does provide a landscape
            with unrivaled potential for exploration and discovery. one of the
            things I love about searching the internet is finding old blogs.
            livejournal, blogspot, you name it. I don't even care how boring the
            blog seems, I just love reading it. it gives me a powerful window
            into the past of a certain person, or even a group of people. often
            a single person will write about their entire friend group, or
            something like that, and I can gain an idea of what their lives were
            like at the time. this is what I'm talking about when I mention
            digital archaeology.<br />
            <hr />
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="d">W</span>hen you find one of these blogs, if you can
            find the person who created it and understand their current internet
            presence, you can form a painting of sorts. a painting of that
            person as they exist <span class="i">right now</span>. and then, you
            can look back at that old blog, and see something that's like a
            slice of that person's life. if a person's life is a painting, then
            that old blog is like a work in progress.
          </p>

            title="this guy is having a rough start to his day!"
          />
          <p>
            to me, that's incredibly special. think of it this way: when a work
            of art is completed, the work in progress no longer exists in any
            meaningful, tangible way. but because this work of art was able to
            document itself at multiple points in time, I now understand the
            work that much better. I can see what things they used to do, what
            type of person they are, and how they evolved over time.

            it's a pretty incredible phenomenon on the internet, in fact &mdash;
            there are all these places that exist as 'abandoned buildings', as
            it were. you know how sometimes you'll see

              >whatever reason?</a
            >
            you often see a bunch of stuff that wouldn't usually be abandoned,
            or the state of the room otherwise looks as if people could have
            lived in it not a day before. that's what it's like for me to find a
            defunct personal website these days. you can read that person's
            thoughts, see what they were up to, understand what their life was
            like &mdash; and then you look at the most recent post and it's like
            'this post was made january fifth, two thousand six' or something.
            that place rests entirely in suspended animation, complete with an
            earlier version of it's owner, almost like a ghost haunting an old
            building &mdash; but the human is still alive and has moved on.
          </p>

            a lot of searching the internet is like being an archeologist. you
            find things that no one has seen in many, many years and you can try
            to determing what it is that you've found, or who this person is in
            this image you have, or what this webpage was for before it was
            abandoned. no matter how uninteresting the blog, it always holds
            some treasure &mdash;

            preservation of history is paramount in a place where everything
            changes so rapidly, which is why archiving things like blogs is so
            interesting to me. it's one of the reasons I write this blog. I
            think it's nice to have these things that will serve as time
            capsules for people in the future. and I'll keep gathering
            information from blogs and any other sites that came before my time
            until I no longer can &mdash; each one is special.<br />

            <span class="d">T</span>hanks for reading! I'll be back soon with
            something else. I'm about to start a new job with an amazing
            company, but that's not for a month or so. in the mean time, I'm
            working on a digital collection application for archivists,
            researchers, and information addicts like me. it's still in the
            planning stage but I'm very very excited about it! when finished, it
            will be the second useful piece of software I have made. I plan on
            posting about it when I make some progress on the interface.
