        <div id="mkzBody">
          <p>
            late last year I was at a tech conference in atlanta when a guy
            asked me about something regarding
            <abbr
              title="this is way more dangerous than asking me about the web in general."
              >mobile web design</abbr
            >. anytime this subject comes up I usually can't help but talk about
            what a horrible place the mobile web is. for the top one percent of
            people with blazing-fast connections and nice large iphone screens,
            maybe the mobile web isn't too bad. but most people are faced with a
            web riddled with horrible load times, poor performance, and
            difficult-to-navigate interfaces that are not optimized for mobile
            devices.<br />
            <hr />
          </p>
          <p>
            I think the mobile web can yet be saved, but it's in a grim
            situation right now. here are some statistics about the current
            situation:
          </p>
          <p>
            most internet traffic
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet"
              >is from mobile devices</a
            >
            &mdash; above fifty percent. that number will likely increase. and
            yet, most websites feel like total crap when viewing them on a
            mobile device.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/mobile-vs-desktop-market-share.png"
            alt="mobile versus desktop versus tablet."
            title="mobile versus desktop versus tablet."
          />
          <p>
            on top of that, the desktop web isn't doing great either. poorly
            designed websites and horribly implemented wordpress templates
            perforate the surface of the web, creating some sort of
            <span class="u">desert wasteland</span> with tiny oases dotting the
            landscape. cookie banners, privacy policy popups, and paywalls are
            around every corner. and even these are only a
            <span class="i">few</span> of the surface level problems affecting
            the mobile web and the desktop web.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/medium-paywall.png"
            alt="an example of a fairly well-known paywall."
            title="an example of a fairly well-known paywall."
          />
          <p>
            maybe the worst thing of all is that there are millions of
            developers who don't care if their software will give the best
            possible experience to their users or not &mdash; as long as it
            makes money. it's like if a gardener just let their plants die after
            harvesting their fruit, treating their garden with complete
            disrespect. I understand that some people by some twist of fate just
            have to do this to make ends meet, and I pity them. however, if you
            touch the garden of the web by choice, and do so without any care
            for the quality of the experience you provide,
            <abbr
              title="get out of web development, or whatever you do that affects the internet. and stay away, for the love of all that is good in this world. you are acting like a sociopath, a literal misanthrope. the web desperately needs less people like you. you are worthless to the web. your work is pointless, and as you exist, you are less than nothing--a true negative effect, a parasite. the future of the internet lies in sustainable web development, and you will be left behind."
              ><span class="u">then...</span></abbr
            ><br />
            <hr />
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="d">I</span> mentor several web development students
            these days. I usually ask them what made them want to become a web
            developer. the answer usually involves money, or some noncommittal
            "I just like computers" type answer. while I do understand this, I
            really want to see more new people entering the field with a fierce
            passion for making the web a better place. people who have
            experienced a wide spectrum what the web has to offer over the years
            and said "yeah, I can do better than that". people like that are so
            rare, I think. it's kind of unfortunate.
          </p>
          <p>
            so, for a long time now, I've been looking for ways to make the
            internet a more beautiful place &mdash; and inspire others to do the
            same. and even more than that &mdash; like I said &mdash; I've been
            looking for people who care about this as much as I do.
            <span class="i"
              >if that sounds like you, please tell me what you're doing and
              <abbr title="(if you want to)">what you've found</abbr>.</span
            >
            you can contact me using the discord or twitter links below.
          </p>
          <p>
            the thing is, the internet is made for humans. the internet is a
            tool for sharing information. it really doesn't go much further.
          </p>
          <p>
            plant a garden in the wasteland. or at least a few flowers while you
            still can. the internet is counting on you. I'm counting on you
            too!<br />
            <hr />
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="d">W</span>hat I'll be doing: I am actively,
            relentlessly researching actionable, simple ways to make the web a
            better place. I will be posting what I find whenever I find it both
            here on this blog, and on
            <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jpegzilla"
              >my twitter</a
            >. this blog post mainly was to serve as an intro to what I'm
            working on / a call to action (?) / cry for help (?) / something.
            I'm still trying to figure this out. thanks for reading.<br />
