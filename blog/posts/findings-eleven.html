<p><span class='d'>H</span>ello again! I've been working on a couple of large writing projects for a few months now, so I haven't been quite as active on this blog as I'd like to be. I'm back now though! thanks for sticking around. of course, I never really stop collecting findings, so here's some that I've had piled up for a few weeks now.<br><hr></p>
<h2>number one: <a target="_blank" href="https://actofplay.com/rejecta/">rejecta</a>.</h2>
<p>I've been in love with this piece of writing ever since I discovered it a couple of months ago. <a target="_blank" href="http://actofplay.com/">pietro righi riva</a> wrote this as a 'nontraditional playable media manifesto' and it serves as their guidelines for creating games.</p>
<img src="../img/findings11/rejecta.png" alt="an image of a portion of the rejecta. it contains rules four through six. I love the way it's written!" title="an image of a portion of the rejecta. it contains rules four through six. I love the way it's written!">
<p>I liked it so much that I decided to make something similar for my style of website design and development. it's finished, and I would link to it here, but I haven't come up with a catchy name for it yet! so it sits in my editor until I figure out what to call it. oh well. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.karlton.org/2017/12/naming-things-hard/">two hard things, right?</a><br><hr></p>
<h2>number two: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codementor.io/@gbbofh/general-tips-for-reverse-engineering-files-156eju2qfz">tips for reverse engineering files.</a></h2>
<p>this one was particularly interesting to me because I've been (slowly) working on a rhythm game whose file format is loosely based on that of <a target="_blank" href="http://bm98.yaneu.com/bm98/bmsformat.html">bemani's format</a> for storing song data. this project was actually my first time seriously reading a format spec for a reason, so I became pretty interested in learning how to reverse engineer files. in my quest for more knowledge, I came across <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codementor.io/@gbbofh/general-tips-for-reverse-engineering-files-156eju2qfz">this blog post</a> by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gbbofh">garret bates</a>. I think it's a pretty interesting read, even if you only read file format specs for fun, like I used to (lol).<br><hr></p>
<h2>number three: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ubu.com/sound/">ubuweb/sound.</a></h2>
<p>this is a large archive of sound clips. according to the website, all clips 'are either out-of-print, incredibly difficult to find, or, in our opinion, absurdly overpriced'. this is an incredible resource for some really interesting audio.</p>
<img src="./../img/findings11/ubuweb.png" alt="an image of a sound clip page. it shows a simplistic audio player, a list of tracks, and the author and title of the track - jaques derrida, circonfession." title="an image of a sound clip page. it shows a simplistic audio player, a list of tracks, and the author and title of the track - jaques derrida, circonfession.">
<p>you could use it for whatever, but I think strange and interesting vocal clips lend themselves really well to odd music sketches.</p>
<p><audio controls style='width: 100%;' src='./../audio/findings11/matilda.wav' alt='a short clip of a song I made 2 years ago from a clip of natalia poklonskaya talking about the film matilda.' title='a short clip of a song I made 2 years ago from a clip of natalia poklonskaya talking about the film matilda.'></audio></p>
<p>take a look at the clips and see what you can do!<br><hr></p>
<h2>number four: <a target="_blank" href="http://gchess.bizland.com/Chess%20Lessons%20-%20Shah%20Mat.htm">the meaning of shah mat</a>.</h2>
<p>having listened to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9l4hdMGqd0">shah mat</a> by <a target="_blank" href="https://themusmus.com">the musmus</a> like a million times, I started wondering what <span class='i'>shah mat</span> actually meant. I was able to quickly find out that it was a chess term, and then eventually stumbled upon this great article by jan newton from 2003.</p>
<img src="./../img/findings11/shah-mat.png" alt="an image of the header of the article. it's called CHESS LESSONS." title="an image of the header of the article. it's called CHESS LESSONS.">
<p>it's a cool bit of trivia &mdash; the type of thing that I love &mdash; and it might be interesting to you as well!<br><hr></p>
<p><span class='d'>S</span>o I used to try force myself to work with these findings articles until I had at least five findings, but I think from now on I'll just write until I get distracted and leave the flow state. it feels better that way. thanks for reading, and I think I'll be back soon with something interesting!<br><hr></p>
