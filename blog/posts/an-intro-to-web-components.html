            using
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components"

            to rebuild my personal website. I've learned a lot about how they
            work, so it's time to document some of that information for people
            who might want it.
          </p>
          <p>
            the last time I wrote an article about how to use this set of
            technologies, it was more geared toward people who already know
            react or some other component system, so this time it's going to be
            geared toward newcomers. plus,
            <abbr title="it's stinky and I don't like it >:("
              >react sucks anyway</abbr
            >, and I think web components are the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            this is going to be a short one! depending on how fast you'd like to
            go, I think it'll only take about 15-20 minutes to complete the
            example project. this is just a guess though, might take longer if
            you don't have some of the things in the initial setup section.<br />

          <h2>assumptions I'm going to make.</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="d">I</span>n order to do the stuff in this post, I'm
            assuming right now that you have some understanding of how to use
            the command line, how to use
            <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm"
              >the npm cli</a
            >, and how to use html / css / javascript. that's about it!
          </p>
          <p>
            I <span class="i">won't</span> assume you know much about other
            component systems like react, but if you already do, this post might
            feel pretty basic.<br />
            <hr />
          </p>
          <h2>initial setup.</h2>
          <p>
            there really isn't much setup required to get started with web
            components (because all the stuff you actually need is included in
            javascript already). however, I'll show you some stuff that I use to
            make my development process easier. neither of these are really
            required, but they might be useful for you too &mdash; still,
            <abbr title="...is the whole of the law.">do what thou wilt</abbr>.
          </p>
          <h3>
            one:
            <a target="_blank" href="https://sass-lang.com/install"
              >sass - css preprocessor</a
            >
          </h3>
          <p>
            if you're still using regular old css in 2021, you
            <span class="i">might</span> be missing out. I'm not going to preach
            to you about this one, but sass makes writing css a lot more fun
            (and also the syntax is pretty, which is important to me at least).
          </p>
          <p>
            again though, this isn't <span class="i">really</span> required.
            also, you can write css straight inside web components (which I'll
            show you) and you can only write sass in an external file.
          </p>
          <h3>two: some sort of boilerplate</h3>
          <p>
            in all my personal web projects, I use a tool I made called
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jpegzilla-init"
              >jpegzilla-init</a
            >
            (I know, really creative) to set up a foundation. if you run
            <span class="c">npm i -g jpegzilla-init</span>, you can use it.
          </p>
          <p>
            to set up a basic web component project here, you'd run
            <span class="c">jpegzilla-init</span> inside your (empty) project
            folder and then follow the prompts (or run
            <span class="c">jpegzilla-init -w</span> to use the default setup).
            then, run something to compile the sass (this is important!!). the
            command you can use if you used
            <span class="c">jpegzilla-init</span> is:
          </p>
          <code
            >sass --watch --style=compressed
            ./css/main.sass:./css/main.min.css</code
          >
          <p>
            ...replacing .sass with .scss if you're
            <a target="_blank" href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax"
              >using scss instead of sass</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h3>getting everything running.</h3>
          <p>
            ok, so now what you have to do is serve your files and get ready to
            build stuff. you need some kind of tool that behaves like a web
            server that you'll use to preview your website while you're working
            on it. for our purposes,
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server"
              >the live-server npm package</a
            >
            will do the trick! so <span class="c">npm i -g live-server</span>,
            and then run <span class="c">live-server</span> in your project
            directory. the site should just open in your browser, totally blank.
          </p>
          <p>
            also &mdash; if you're using sass, now is the time to run that sass
            command written above. I like to make this command into an
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts/"
              >npm script</a
            >
            in a <span class="c">package.json</span> file, that way I can just
            type <span class="c">npm run sass</span> or something and then I
            don't have to type out that whole long command. hell, you could even
            make it into a
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Aliases.html"
              >bash alias</a
            >
            if you wanted to.<br />
            <hr />
          </p>
          <h2>building a web component.</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="d">N</span>ow that the environment is prepared, it's
            time to open up your text editor and make a new web component. the
            baseline setup to create a new
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements"
              >custom element</a
            >
            for your component looks something like this:
          </p>
          <code>class NewElement extends HTMLElement {}</code>
          <p>
            what we're doing here is defining a new
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/extends"
              >class that extends</a
            >
            &mdash; or builds on top of &mdash; the functionality of a regular
            old html element.
          </p>
          <p>
            we'll end up with an element that we can work with in the same way
            as all other html elements &mdash; but potentially much more
            powerful than the base set of elements, and greater than the sum of
            its parts. something reusable, modifiable, and extensible. a
            <span class="i">component</span> that can become a part of a larger
            interface, just like a react component or something.
          </p>
          <p>
            if you're using the setup from
            <span class="c">jpegzilla-init</span> (which I recommend you do!),
            you'll see a file called <span class="c">component.js</span> (or
            <span class="c">component.mjs</span>). inside this file is a class
            that extends the native <span class="c">HTMLElement</span> and gives
            it extra powers. the methods that you see in this class &mdash;
            <span class="c">toggleClass</span>, <span class="c">setId</span>,
            etc. &mdash; will be available on our new element just like regular
            html element methods, like
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              target="_blank"
              ><span class="c">querySelector</span></a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            either way, here's how we're going to create our own custom element.
            make a javascript file inside the folder you're storing your
            components inside. the name should be whatever your component is
            going to be called. inside that file, you're going to
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export"
              >export</a
            >
            a class of the same name that will extend an html element. if you're
            using <span class="c">jpegzilla-init</span>, you'll be
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/import"
              >import</a
            >ing and extending the included
            <span class="c">Component</span> class.
          </p>
          <p>here's an example of what you should have after this step:</p>
          <code
            >import Component from './component.mjs'<br />class NewElement
            extends Component {}<br />export default { element: NewElement,
            name: 'new-element' }</code
          >
          <p>
            let's go through this line by line, since it's the basis of
            everything we'll be doing afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="b">one: importing the base component.</span> the base
            component is described above, and included in the base project. it's
            just an extension of javascript's
            <span class="c">HTMLElement</span> class. if you don't feel like
            using my default project, you can extend
            <span class="c">HTMLElement</span> yourself!
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="b">two: creating our new element class.</span> in the
            second line we create a new element by extending the base component.
            again, this is just allowing us to add more functionality to the
            base <span class="c">Component</span> class.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="b">three: exporting the element.</span> you'll notice
            that in the third line, we're exporting an object containing the
            actual class as well as the name of the class. the reason for this
            will become apparent when I show you how we're going to
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry/define"
              >register each element</a
            >
            that we create.
          </p>
          <p>
            the mechanism for this registration is inside your main javascript
            file (assuming you're using the default project). you might be able
            to see what it's going to do, but don't worry if you don't
            understand it now. I'll explain it when it's time! for now, let's
            finish building our component.<br />
            <hr />
          </p>
          <h3>writing the html.</h3>
          <p>
            the first step for writing the html structure in your custom
            component involves adding a method to your class called
            <span class="c">connectedCallback</span>. this method fires whenever
            you add the custom element to the DOM, so this is where we can write
            the html. you just have to set
            <span class="c">this.innerHTML</span> to your desired html.
          </p>
          <code
            >connectedCallback() {<br />&emsp;this.innerHTML = &lt;p&gt;hello
            world&lt;/p&gt;<br />}</code
          >
          <p>
            now you have a custom element that displays the text 'hello world'
            (or whatever you decide to put in there). now we have to get the
            element to show up on our web page!<br />
            <hr />
          </p>
          <h3>registering our element.</h3>
          <p>
            inside our <span class="c">main</span> javascript file, you'll see a
            console log, an empty array, and a loop that iterates over that
            array. we can go ahead and remove the console log and import our
            element. something like this:
          </p>
          <code>import NewElement from './components/newelement.mjs'</code>
          <p>
            now, place <span class="c">NewElement</span> into the
            <span class="c">elements</span> array. this array is used as a
            collection of all our custom elements so that they can all be
            registered when the javascript loads. the actual registering is done
            by the <span class="c">customElements.define</span> function in the
            loop! the
            <a

              >function used to define custom elements</a
            >
            enables our new element to be used like a regular element in our
            html document, under the name that we gave it. in this example, our
            element is called <span class="c">new-element</span>. let's put that
            in our html document's <span class="c">&lt;body></span> tag.
            something like this:
          </p>
          <code
            >...<br />&lt;body><br />&emsp;&lt;new-element&gt;&lt;/new-element&gt;<br />&lt;/body><br />...</code
          >
          <p>
            now, if you go back to your browser, you should see the element
            actually being rendered in the page. now you've gone through the
            whole process of creating and using a web component from beginning
            to end. nicely done!<br />

            <span class="d">T</span>his <span class="i">is</span> only an
            introduction, so I think that at this point you have all you need to
            get started from scratch with web components. anything else involved
            with developing a site using web components isn't really specific to
            web components. meaning anything you can do with regular html /
            react / etc, you can do with web components.

            I'll probably follow up this post with maybe some stuff about the

            or whatever else I think could be useful or interesting. until then,
            have fun and good luck.
