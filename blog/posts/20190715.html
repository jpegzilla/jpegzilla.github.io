            <span class="d">I</span>'ve been pretty consistently finding things
            I want to talk about online recently &mdash; but most of my energy
            has been going toward building my code portfolio on github. I've
            been learning cryptography through writing hashing algorithms,
            building a webrtc react application, practicing my ruby and php, and
            writing a rhythm game &mdash; among other things.
          </p>
          <p>
            this week (or <span class="i">weeks</span>, I guess) I decided to
            try out the tool I made for automating content discovery a little
            bit. the tool in question only searches the information organization
            tool <a target="_blank" href="https://are.na">are.na</a>, but the
            amount of content is so vast that even randomly retrieving links
            gets good results. I fired up randomarena (my extremely creative
            name for the tool) and found a couple of things that I wanted to
            learn more about. hope you enjoy this weeks hodgepodge:

          </h2>
          <p>
            this is a tool for creating blurry photos. does what it says on the
            tin. it's got rave reviews:

          <p>
            I've been doing a lot of experimentation with digital collage
            techniques as part of my recent design works (which I hope to post
            about soon), and...well, sometimes you just need a nice blurry
            picture. or even an entire

          />
          <p>
            magic sketchpad is a machine learning art project created using
            magenta.js, a javascript api that translates the functionality of
            the magenta python library to a browser environment. it's fun to
            play with!
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            this is a magic sketchpad-assisted drawing of 'everything'.
            machine-learning algorithms creating art &mdash; no matter the style
            &mdash; always seem to create pieces reminiscent of that "<a

            >.
          </h2>
          <p>
            the aerial bold (get it?) typewriter is a site where you can type
            out some words, and then each letter is replaced by an aerial
            landscape image that sort of looks like the letter it replaced. it
            also plays funky sounds when you're typing.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./../img/aerial-typewriter-hello.png"

            title="'hello there!' written in the aerial bold typewriter."
          />
          <p>
            this project is pretty gigantic and required years of work from
            many, many people. I can't really explain all the things that went
            into it, but it is really cool. take a look!
          </p>

          </h2>
          <p>
            tone.js is a javascript framework for creating interactive music. it
            uses javascript's native web audio api to create a slew of
            impressive features such as synthesizers and various audio effects.
          </p>

            title="a collection of demos created with the tone.js framework."
          />
          <p>
            the main reason I've been researching web audio-related stuff is
            because of the rhythm game I'm currently working on, so this is
            really interesting to me! if you're also interested in the
            possibilities of a web-based music creation framework, check this
            out and check out some of the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://tonejs.github.io/demos"
              >demos here</a

            this isn't new to me per se, but I was just reminded of it while I
            was listening to
            <a target="_blank" href="https://lemondemon.bandcamp.com/"
              >lemon demon</a

              >redesign your logo</a
            >. it showcases just how much thought can go into graphic design,
            especially when designers are working for globally recognizable
            brands that have to appeal to hundreds of millions of people. it
            might read like the lesser key of solomon, but the techniques,
            methods, and relationships described in the document are legitimate
            concerns when design is done at such a scale. also, a recent design
            document for coca cola is just as complex &mdash; if less esoteric
            &mdash; and is one hundred and forty-six pages long.<br />

            <span class="i">side note:</span> some of the links that I stumbled
            upon were previously collected and posted by
            <a target="_blank" href="https://elliott.computer">elliott cost</a>,
            and there's a lot of interesting stuff on their site that I didn't
            write about but found to be super cool, so check it out if you want
            to.<br />

          <p>
            <span class="d">I</span>'m moving really soon and hopefully
            transitioning into a new job. a lot of stuff is changing really
            quickly in my life right now, and I'm trying to keep up.
          </p>
          <p>
            although I'll be extremely busy, I hope I can put out another post
            later this week! I'm working on a couple of cool projects that I
            want to write about pretty soon. so, to the person reading this,
            thank you so much, and I hope something I found was interesting or
            useful to you. see you later!<br />
